      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-i-learned-from-watching-jonathan-blow-streams-so-you-dont-have-to&#34;&gt;What I learned from watching Jonathan Blow streams, so you don’t have to&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Blow makes twitch streams dates back to a dacade and I think what he is doing is showing what software development is in context of game programming but in general what the essence of programming is. I watched old and new videos from youtube and twitch. Jon has a lot of opinion about a lot things which people asking about, I am not agree most of the arguments he is making but those are not the thing we are gonna talk about in this article.  These thoughts are not new things but worth to remember and watching these videos reminded me what we are doing in reality, not praising how glorious software development is. Let&amp;rsquo;s start.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
