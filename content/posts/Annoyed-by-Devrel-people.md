# Why I am annoyed by devrel and fanboys

# Please Devrel and Fanboys are out!!

Do not beleive or trust anything said from Devrel people, which they paid say and defend their employer. Which practically they like HR, their side is companies side not your side. I thought this knowledge is plain and simple but I am still awe in people that look them like truth teller. Thousand times we saw that defend their company like their salary depends on it(Ooopss!!).

There is a [blogpost](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/01/06/fire-and-motion/) by Joel Spolsky about how big companies use continuesly marketing usesless new things to force users to learn and adapt and make them paralyze. Not letting them work on what actually matters. Users, in our case developers, always keeps learning things that not actually matters or adds anything drastically change how they work on their actual jobs. What we are doing is only reacting things pops up everywhere but those things does not change how computers or web works.

So companies do those things in developer community by DevRel people and fanboys. If we accept DevRel as a marketing then we are ok. Everything they say is not actual thing but just marketing talk. My problem starts when people think or pretends as otherwise. Like they part of fellow developers not marketings. NinetyNine percent of time they only gives conference talk about hello world samples on new things that their companies promotes.

One thing that I do not like is, if their companies do not want to add, a wanted feature from users, they are defending that company's decision with their life. They litarely belittle people about asking about those features. I am gonna give a few examples here, which I know people gonna defend them and gonna talk about me, not about arguments.

Everyone complained about how verbose Java is, but on social media or at conferences Oracle Devrel employees mock people for asking about making language more concise. Now because other languages make them absolute, and they fear of demise of Java, they trying to add features more frequantly and, to write less and more concise code. Now Oracle DevRel/Marketing guys promotes these features, forgets how they treat people for only asking those features and, they were defending to not add anything to the Java language. Now they defending like these feature wanted by them. Another example, Kotlin Devrel people tried to mock and belittle people for asking Kotlin LSP, I saw with my own eyes in Kotlin conference Devrel Manager talked down by a few jokes and belittle developers for asking Kotlin LSP and not even try to answer questions. Now they added Kotlin LSP and forget how they treated people, just even for asking it. And Golang fanboys, before and after adding generics to the langauge. Not gonna say anything about them. Now you know the drill. There are a lot of examples like Microsoft is king of this treatment.

This hypocrasy from Devrel/Fanboy people is disgusting. They are just puppet soilders defend companies every decisions, even if they clash each other. You may say not every DevRel/Fanboy is like this but you forgetting what thier job really is. Defending companies against everyone and marketting features by writing and talking.

DevRel is not your developer friend, do not pretend otherwise. And do not respond every fucking new features or things that promote to you. They are time theifs, focus on what is on your plate.
