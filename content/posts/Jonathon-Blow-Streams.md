# What I learned from watching Jonathan Blow streams, so you don’t have to

Jonathan Blow makes twitch streams dates back to a dacade and I think what he is doing is showing what software development is in context of game programming but in general what the essence of programming is. I watched old and new videos from youtube and twitch. Jon has a lot of opinion about a lot things which people asking about, I am not agree most of the arguments he is making but those are not the thing we are gonna talk about in this article.  These thoughts are not new things but worth to remember and watching these videos reminded me what we are doing in reality, not praising how glorious software development is. Let's start.

## 1 - It is lonely business 

Yes, software development is lonely at core. That's why most people in the our domain are introverts that has no problem with working long hours completely alone in their head.       I can see Jon's streams as a some coping machanism

## 2 - it is boring

## 3 - it should be cumulative but system does not let you to it that way

## 4 - graphic api does not matter, this one is very hard to understand if have few years experience in cg or don’t, but it will make sense when you do cg without graphic api, do that if wanna understand or want a job in cg area

## 5 - it is frustrating sometimes and that where you decide if this thing is for you or not, do not pick this job without having frustration not know what to do next to fix or do thing

## 6 - you should look performance after the features you wanted are done, but be mindful about performance while you coding, meaning think perf while coding with your past experience or knowledge, yes there is always gonna be exception, it is hard to know, yes, thats the thing you set out the do, be ok with not knowing until you know

## 7 -  when do thing most things by hand your frustration going to be less because you have control over it, not having control usually means, too much abstraction on your codebase you did not added or maybe you did ???

## 8 -  hiring is hard which is my personnel experience to 

## 9 - this my addition,  

 Jon is very engineer minded person, in loves with what he is doing,  I think that affects games, he is doing on timeline manner,  and that affect peoples who loves his games, which puzzle games, because it means less game he is making.  He takes his time to do his games and programming language which I do not interested because not gonna learn it, only gonna play games he created with that language.  So does he really need a programming language for current game? No. Can he only focus on game design let others to program on some engine, so making more games on less time? Probably yes. He plays games in his streams and he very much likes some of them, does it matter to him which platform or language used for making those games? No. Some of the games he liked made with from puzzle script, Java,  C#, C++, Unreal, Unity etc..  So he knows if games playable and designed good, it does not matter what is used for making them.  On the other hand, tools we use to create things, affects us. In way that, it defines our perception, our reality, affects how we see thing, how we do things. We this all the time in software development, people fight with the tools to make things or do things only,  that tools allows them.  If Jon used existing tools to create Braid or Witness, he probably would burn out in the process. For fighting with tool, gonna hate the process and burn out or tool would affects his imagination on things that tool can do. And that concerns game players likes Jon games in another perspective that different than former one.  So as I can see Jon choose not limited by tools in thinking/perception level and, that costs time.  Choosing is trading, you give up somethings on the process.  

No clear wining answer on this one, but there is a lesson to be taken. You can change name Jon with different name, like your name, it is gonna be same dilemma.  I am aware that for most of the developers or projects, tools are not the problem, un-mature, un-educated minds are the problem. But some of developers that affected by this dilemma, my suggestion is choose your tools by scope, domain and your existing knowledge. No wrong answers, finishing is more important than starting in case of software projects. And you can always reevaluate your constraints on the way.
